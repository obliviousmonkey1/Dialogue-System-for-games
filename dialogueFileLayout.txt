 what we need:
 -> To be able to know which nodes are connected to which response
 -> To be able to take in tags and requirments
 -> To know were in the tree to put this information 
 

Top of the document is the root of the tree
 
 
                        [id] Name <- specifying the type i.e dialogue or response or root

[0, conditon, text, children[id]] Dialogue 
[1, conditon, text, children[id]] Dialogue

                        [id] Response's

[0, conditon, text, children[id]] Response

                            Graph

Diaogue will choose the response based upon what skill, class archatype the player uses the most 
out of all the conditions that are their.

                                root [conditon childen[id]] 
                                 |
                                 |
                             dialogues <- contain a set of dialogues, based on conditions
                                 |
                               __|__
                              |     |
                      response's   response's

Could also be more than one dialogue set, a base and then one that meets the conditon 
Could be used for quests in order to remind the player of what they are doing or 
having some specific dialogue related to them returning and not having done it.
Within graphs should also be the ablity to call of graphs

Shopkeeper MAIN Graph         Shopkeeper QUEST1 graph

If you havent done the quest yet but want to use their wares and items you can 
reference the main graph and maybe a sub tree in it inorder to get the dialogue Options
for wares without having to re-write it. It will then go back to the point it left 
of in QUEST1 graph and terminate or whatever
